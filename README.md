<h1 align="center"> GEANT4 Simulatios for X-ARAPUCA test device </h1>

![Badge concluded](http://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=STATUS&message=CONCLUDEDcolor=GREEN&style=for-the-badge)

This is a project that I developed during my undergraduating research in the Leptons Laboratory at UNICAMP. This simulation aims to simulate the apparatus used in the real experiment performed in the laboratory, the radioactive source used and quantify how many photons arrive in the acceptance window of the X-ARAPUCA light detector.

Three types of simulations were performed, with different ionizing particles: alpha particles, gamma particles and atmospheric muons.

The main result of the simulation consists of a histogram of the number of photons that arrived in the X-ARAPUCA acceptance window per ionizing particle.
